Dijkstra's algorithm implemented as an assigment for the course DAT037 Datastructures in Chalmers University of Technology. 

Lab3.java contains the main.

Contains an unknown error me and the labassistans were unable to find as it did not pass the extensive test, only the smaller test.

The class DijkstraStringPath.java is just a wrapper to be able to run the test, which i have not included here

Lab3Help.jar was given to us by the teacher and I am thus not the author.
